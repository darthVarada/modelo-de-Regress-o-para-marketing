# Sales Prediction Project

## Overview

The Sales Prediction project aims to predict sales based on advertising budgets across various marketing channels. The primary goal is to develop machine learning models to forecast sales accurately, helping marketing teams optimize budget allocations and maximize return on investment.

## Features

1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset, perform any necessary pre-processing steps, and note key observations.

2. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models to predict sales, and outline the training process.

3. **Cross-Validation:** Perform cross-validation to evaluate model performance and gain insights.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Discuss the metrics used to assess the models' performance.

5. **Outliers Handling:** Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.

6. **Predictive Analysis:** Describe how predictions are made and evaluated, including any threshold setting.

7. **Visualizations:** Create visualizations to understand the data and assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Any other relevant technologies
